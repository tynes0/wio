- __Update 1.1.6:__ Has value '?' operator has been added.
- __Update 1.2.0:__ Project filing has been changed.
- __Update 1.2.1:__ Started adding built-in methods. Currently adding instant math and io built-in methods.

- __Update 1.2.6:__ Added 'file' type.
- __Update 1.2.7:__ Removed the need for a semicolon after the import keyword. It is now optional.
- __Update 1.2.8:__ Fixed a bug that caused the program to stop working if a semicolon was used more than once. Empty semicolons are now passed directly without being evaluated.
