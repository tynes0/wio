# Wio VM Native Bridge

Status: Sprint 20 implementation in progress.

The VM consumes the same wire-v2 `WioNativeAbiRegistry` and concrete native
thunks as the Lowered-WIR C++ backend and host SDK. It does not use a second FFI
contract and does not attempt to reproduce C++ overload, template, or layout
rules at runtime. The compiler resolves those rules and emits one stable native
key and ABI plan before bytecode generation.

## Sprint 20.1 registry and synchronous values

`Machine::registerNativeRegistry(...)` validates and copies every descriptor.
The descriptor array may be released after registration, while the containing
native library and thunk code must remain loaded until the machine can no
longer execute those functions. Registration is idempotent for the same stable
key/thunk pair and rejects rebinding a key to different code.

`NativeInvoke` resolves its external bytecode declaration by stable key and
executes the registered wire-v2 thunk. This slice supports:

- bool, signed/unsigned integer, and floating-point scalars;
- byte-preserving UTF-8 `string` values;
- scalar-valid UTF-32 `text` values;
- nullable wire void only where the Wio declaration is nullable;
- immutable `view` and mutable `ref` tokens over VM places;
- alias-preserving reference tokens and mutable copy-back, including copy-back
  when a native thunk reports a translated failure;
- native failure category, message, and native-code capture;
- deterministic rejection of missing registrations, ABI-version mismatches,
  conflicting stable keys, unsupported marshalling, and incorrect result kinds.

The bytecode verifier requires every `NativeInvoke` to match one external
function declaration, parameter list, result type, and encoded ABI plan.

Current stable diagnostics are:

- `WVM1220`: invalid or unregistered native target;
- `WVM1221`: invocation shape does not match the ABI plan;
- `WVM1222`: native thunk reported failure;
- `WVM1223`: argument conversion or reference validation failed;
- `WVM1224`: result or mutable-reference copy-back conversion failed;
- `WVM1225`: the requested marshalling/passing mode belongs to a later bridge
  slice.

## Sprint 20.2 foreign storage and ownership

The VM now has explicit value kinds for native POD bytes, opaque pointers,
foreign objects, and foreign runtime values. Native POD results are copied into
VM-owned byte storage. The other kinds retain the producer-supplied wire-v2
handle operations and release them when the last VM `Value` storage reference
dies. The VM never directly deletes memory created by a native library.

POD, object, and runtime-value ABI plans require reflection metadata with a
non-zero stable type id. The bytecode verifier rejects a missing identity as
`WBC1074`; the bridge checks both the wire value's id and the producer handle's
`typeId` operation before admitting it. Opaque pointers remain pointer-shaped
and may optionally carry a producer owner handle.

Copying a VM `Value` only increments the VM storage reference count. One
producer retain is held by that shared storage, so the final VM copy performs
exactly one matching producer release. Borrowed arguments expose the stored
handle for the duration of the synchronous thunk without transferring
ownership. Owned results are retained before the native frame releases its
wire value.

## Remaining Sprint 20 surface

The next slices add VM-backed callbacks with call/retained lifetime and
caller/any-thread enforcement,
foreign-thread entry and completion scheduling, native async-task adaptation,
library loading/registry discovery, CLI/project integration, and the full
C++-backend-versus-VM native differential gate.
